### 👨‍💻 About Me

I am a **Mid-Level Software Engineer** with a strong background in **Full-Stack development**, specializing in **Backend Architecture** and system scalability. I am passionate about modernizing legacy systems and designing solutions that drive operational efficiency.

My approach combines technical precision with strategic business alignment—whether it's restructuring monolithic applications into microservices or optimizing data frameworks to eliminate redundancy. I thrive in environments that value **Clean Architecture**, **DDD**, and **Continuous Improvement**.

### 🚀 Professional Impact & Featured Work

My work focuses on solving critical business challenges through engineering. Here are a few highlights:

* **Microservices Architecture & Scalability** Restructured the *Rig/Well Catalog* legacy application into multiple microservices. This modernization prepared the system for future integrations and significantly improved scalability and maintainability.

* **Data Framework Optimization (CoDaF)** Led the technical optimization of an internal data persistence framework. By creating a centralized base, I **eliminated information redundancy** and ensured data consistency across multiple projects, boosting operational efficiency.

* **Revenue Protection (License Manager)** Architected and implemented a License Manager solution to control client access. This system protected intellectual property and revenue streams by ensuring clients only utilized contracted features.

* **Database Modeling & Mentorship** Conducted interviews with domain specialists to model a general-use database for Oil & Gas solutions, resulting in a robust foundation with approximately **100 entities** that serves as a pillar for new projects.

* **Reverse Engineering & Unblocking Teams** Performed reverse engineering on undocumented legacy applications (Rig State), providing clarity on business rules that allowed the team to proceed with critical modifications safely and with agility.
